the lexer/parser is already going to have to handle lexical (/, leading to, synactic) ambiguity. should we have a :DIR (role? feature? category?) assigned by special prepositions so that verbs like "go" can SEL: DIR, rather than SEL: UP or DOWN or LEFT or AROUND... etc...? these could be CAT: :DIR... then they could be functionally similar to their (presumably very related) CAT: :P counterparts, but merge-selected (rather than sem-selected), much better. that is, for instance, [GO {:CAT V, :SEL [_ DIR]}], and [UP {:CAT DIR, :DIR DIR_UP, :SEL [_ (GOAL)]}]. Then, GO can parse with (get-highest {:DIR}) for direction, with optional object (get-highest {:ROLE :GOAL}).

continuation: do we even need CAT P? when would this be useful?...
"put" really does not seem to be a direction-requiring verb... "put south" makes no sense, so we'd have to s-select against "south" if CAT P didn't exist. On the other hand, in the assumed case where [PUT V SEL: [_ [N :DOBJ] P]]], we can have [ON {:CAT P, :SEL [_ [N GOAL]]}]. Difficulty here... "put on" is a seperable verb that we should account for..? could place this in V:PUT (a la "put the bottle on the desk"), but then we have to account for null DOBJ, see: "put on the shirt"... in this case, "the shirt" is assigned GOAL, but can also be assigned DOBJ in the separated case ("put the shirt on"). Difficult to parse this while also making way for conventional V:PUT "put the bottle on the desk". Really seems like we should, instead, have a distinct prefix, so we can s-select it: (not sure if its category matters..?) ["on" {:CAT PARTICLE, :SEL [_]}], and [PUT-ON-1 "put" {:CAT V, :SEL [_ [N DOBJ] ON-PARTICLE]}] and [PUT-ON-2 "put" {:CAT V, :SEL [_ ON-PARTICLE [N DOBJ]]}]? this seems annoying... would have to do for every seperable verb.

wow, seperable verbs suck. without introducing movement (lol), we could simply... not let them happen? assume no promotion of N to SPEC-v', so we always get "PUT ON [DOBJ]", "CALL UP [DOBJ]". After some research, there is only one case in English where this is deficient: pronouns cannot extract from the small clause (Svenonius), or something of the sort, and so we get "pick the book up"<->"pick up the book"; but "pick it up"/*pick up it". quite interesting. I think that, for the purposes of any iteration of Petra, this is a concern that can be ignored, to the suitability of restricting "pick the book up", i.e., endowing the lexicon only with the idiomatic single item "pick up [DOBJ]". perhaps, in this case in particular, the single verb "pick" does not even exist, and so "pick the book up" would respond with something like "I'm not sure what 'pick' means". This is at least slightly confusing (especially problematic if the user, a non-linguist, fails to gather that "pick .. up" is not being computed as a single item here (movement is calculated very subconsciously), and abandons the attempt to use V:TAKE entirely). However, I have hope that most people would see the problem and modify their utterance "pick up the book". I think this is the way to proceed, here.
